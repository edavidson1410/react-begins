            <p>Welcome to my journey on beginning React.</p>
            <p>Many say that they are tired of seeing the same React Projects. Counters. Weather Apps. A Pokedex.</p>
            <p>Sorry to tell you, this is exactly what that is. My slow climb up the ladder with generic React Projects.</p>
            <p>As I build the site, I hope to increase my skills, add a backend, and make this satire site my own.</p>
